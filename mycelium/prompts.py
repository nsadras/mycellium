"""
    user = f"""

The following is a transcript of a conversation that the agent had with the user:
-- TRANSCRIPT --

{transcript}

---END OF TRANSCRIPT--

INSTRUCTIONS:
Extract information from the transcript that may be relevant to future interactions with the user. Capture generously — a separate consolidation process will edit, abstract, and prune. Your job is to be a journalist, not an editor.

Treat user messages as the primary source of factual memory. Agent messages provide context for understanding what the user was responding to. Tool calls, tool results, file edits, test results, search results, and other system observations are also valid memory sources.

Always capture:
- User identity, background, expertise, constraints, preferences, goals, and long-running plans
- Project facts, implementation decisions, architecture choices, bugs, and open questions
- Commitments, task state, unresolved follow-ups, and facts supplied by the user
- Stable concepts or abstractions that emerged from the interaction
- Recommendations or plans you gave that were tailored to this user's specific context
- How the user responded to agent suggestions — whether they accepted, pushed back, modified, or ignored them
- Anything the agent would want to know to pick up this conversation coherently, without the full conversation transcript

For assistant-originated content:
- Capture recommendations, plans, and explanations that were personalized to this user — but write them as interaction memory, not universal fact
- Use phrasing like "Agent recommended..." or "A proposed plan for the user is..." rather than asserting advice as objective truth

Examples:
- Skip: "RLHF uses reward models and PPO." (generic knowledge, already in weights)
- Keep (unconfirmed): "Agent proposed model-based RL and POMDPs as project directions given the user's computational neuroscience background. User has not yet confirmed this direction."
- Keep (confirmed): "The user confirmed they will pursue a POMDP-based approach for their BCI project, building on the agent's recommendation."

For each entry, output a json object with the following fields:
- "content": one concise standalone memory fact written so a future agent can use it without the transcript. Always include what makes this specific to this user, not just the bare fact.
- "durability": one of "ephemeral" (single session relevance only), "session" (relevant for days), "durable" (stable until explicitly updated)
- "importance": "low", "medium", or "high"

Return a JSON object with a single "entries" field containing a list of these objects. Respond with valid JSON only. No markdown code fences, no explanation, no preamble.

Group related log entries into the smallest useful set of semantic pages. Do not create one page per log entry.
Prefer updating an existing page from the wiki index when the new information fits its topic, even if the fit is approximate.
Create a new page only when no existing page can reasonably absorb the information.
Use stable lowercase slug names with hyphens, for example "user-profile" or "reinforcement-learning". Do not return placeholder names like "Page 1", "Topic A", or "New Page".
If multiple log entries concern the same theme, return one page target for that theme.

Important: Log entries with IDs starting with 'tool-' contain direct system tool observations (such as web search or fetch results). Carefully analyze these search results. Extract specific, factual, and actionable details discovered during these queries (e.g., specific library syntax, API specifications, hardware details, or custom scientific facts requested by the user) and identify appropriate wiki pages to create or update to store this permanent knowledge.

    system = """You are rewriting a wiki page to incorporate new experience.
Rules:
- PERSONALIZATION vs GENERAL KNOWLEDGE: The wiki is a Personalized User-Agent Ledger, not a generic encyclopedia. NEVER write general textbook information that is already in your pre-trained weights (e.g. general explanations of basic algorithms, basic Python tutorials). However, you MUST capture specific, specialized, or newly-discovered factual knowledge retrieved via tool calls/web searches (e.g., library version compatibility, fresh API syntaxes, hardware compatibility tables, or documentation pages fetched during the session) that are highly relevant to the user's project. This is information you had to fetch because it is NOT stored in your weights. Save these facts alongside the user's specific decisions, variables, configurations, folder paths, and preferences so they are permanently accessible.
- CAPTURE TOOL RESULTS: Log entries with IDs starting with 'tool-' contain direct system tool observations (such as web search or page fetch results). Integrate any fresh factual discoveries, library version numbers, specific API specifications, or technical details uncovered by these tools into the wiki page to preserve them in permanent context. Do not ignore these search discoveries; they represent the exact new factual information retrieved because it wasn't in your weights!
- ABSTRACT EVENTS, PRESERVE DETAILS: When processing logs, abstract the specific chat turn, but do NOT strip away crucial actionable details like custom file names, custom directories, variable names, or hardware models. Preserve these specifics, but write them as durable facts rather than episodic stories (e.g. write 'The BCI project uses a custom POMDP loop' rather than 'The user said they want to use POMDP').
- AVOID EPISODIC STORIES: Do not write pages as a chronological diary of your chats (e.g. skip 'On May 28, the user asked...'). Write them as structured technical documents or profile cards describing the current status, configurations, and design specifications of the user's project.
- Keep the page focused on one coherent semantic topic. Do not produce the same broad page title for unrelated slugs.
- Resolve conflicts explicitly: if new info contradicts existing content, choose the more recent/credible version and note the revision.
- Update confidence score based on how much evidence now supports this.
- Update related: links if new connections are apparent.
- Increment version.
- Make wiki pages compatible with Obsidian: when referencing another wiki page in markdown content, use double-bracket links like [[project-architecture]].
- Use the page slug inside double brackets, not the title, unless the slug and title are identical.
- If a related edge points to another page, include a natural inline reference to that page with [[target-slug]] where it helps the page read coherently.
